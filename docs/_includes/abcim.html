<p>The alex brady Course in Miracles is a set of steps with the purpose of taking the learner from where they are to personal spiritual enlightenment. These steps are heavily based on the teaching found within the book A Course in Miracles.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p><b>Spiritual enlightenment</b></p>
<p>You have graduated this course when you are enlightened. That is the goal and the result. Not being in an enlightened state is a sign of incomplete learning.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>An honest examination of one's current life situation and belief systems. Finding these situations and systems to be unable to satisfy an inner quest for truth.</p>
<i>Your past learning must have taught you wrong things simply on the basis that it has not made you happy. Dissatisfaction with learning outcomes myst be a sign of learning failure, since it means that you did not get what you want. If the outcome of yours has made you unhappy and you want a different one, a change in curriculum is obviously necessary.</i>

<h4 class="main-point">Cultural Unlearning</h3>
<p class="additional">Comparative looks at what we are told and a set of complete opposite truths.</p>
<p class="additional">Consume two revelatory or "counter culture" art pieces. <a href="https://iamalexbrady.com/blogs/abcim/recommended-media-list" target="_blank" title="recommended media list" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a list of my personal favorite selections.</a> There is a universe of other options. Be able to answer the question:</p>
<p class="additional"><strong>Name one concept the society that you live in in which the values that are espoused do not match behavior.</strong><span>Â </span>Where the story that is told does not match the facts.</p>
<p class="additional">The point not to convince you of other viewpoints. The point is but to present these perspectives as alternative to preconceived truths. Useful for concept debate practice and inner guidance checking.<span>Â </span><a href="http://reddit.com/r/iamalexbrady" target="_blank" title="iamalexbrady reddit" rel="noopener noreferrer">Come discuss on r/iamalexbrady</a>.</p>
<p class="additional">When presented with fact that did not match previous views, you are encouraged to consider that<span>Â </span><i>neither</i><span>Â </span>are true, and to sit with yourself and internal guidance to determine the best truth for the matter.</p>

<p class="example">Suggested order. Can be done simultaneously.</p>
<p class="additional">Start the Text. Finish it, too.</p>
<p class="additional">As soon as you've experienced a miracle by your own definition, begin the workbook and practice it<span>Â </span><u>as written</u>.</p>
<p class="example">You're going to want to wait until you've experienced a miracle. Going through the workbook with high motivation is ideal. Feel free to start sooner.</p>
<p class="additional">Read the Manual when you remember it exists.</p>
<br />
<p class="example">a.b special opinion: If you're not going through the workbook as written, you are<span>Â </span><span class="censored">fuck</span>ing up. If the task for the day is "1 minute per hour every hour say six words" and you miss the goal<span>Â </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span><span>Â </span>hours, you are not going to realize the benefits of mind training because you are not training your mind. Do the workbook right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 class="main-point">Continuing Unlearning</h3>
<p class="additional">The moment you considered any part of alexbrady, you began to come unloosed from the world. About halfway through the workbook, you should have began to see the world in a new light, an understanding that there is more to the world than space and time.</p>
<p class="additional">Next is a gradual process of unlearning. You should have had glimpses from the workbook practice that your mental desires are the sole determiner of your world. The unlearning process, guided by your own internal guidance system, will take you from glimpses to vision.</p>
<p class="additional">Over time you begin to understand how "All things are lessons God would have me learn." You will become a happy learner of these joyful lessons rather than maintain pretenses of egoic upsets.</p>
<p class="additional">Congratulations. ðŸ¥³ You're enlightened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 class="main-point">Christ Guidance</h3>
<p class="additional">You will welcome Christ guidance into your life. You've already always been doing it. You will simply realizeÂ how this is the case, welcome it, and get good at it.</p>
<p class="additional">Congratulations. ðŸ¥³ You're awakened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 class="main-point">Realize you<span>Â </span><em>are</em><span>Â </span>Christ.</h4>
<p class="additional">Congratulations. ðŸ¥³ You're realized.</p>
</li>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h4>Do I have to join the club?</h4>
<p>No. In fact, if youÂ <em>don't</em><span>Â </span>want to, please do not.</p>
<h4>Do I have to read A Course in Miracles?</h4>
<p>This whole list can be abridged to</p>
<ol>
<li>Study A Course in Miracles</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, read ACIM. If you have a different book you like, use that one. I personally cannot guarantee another.</p>
<h4>Is the workbook hard? Why do people not do it correctly?</h4>
<p>The workbook is very simple. Part of the mind training process is to learn to train your attention. Lack of<span>Â </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span><span>Â </span>we are training -- mental strength and attention -- is the impediment to the training.</p>
<p>Be patient with yourself. When you begin to experience the benefits of consistent practice, you will be motivated to engage more.</p>
<h4>How do you know I will have a miracle?</h4>
<p>You are doing miracles all the time, you just aren't realizing it. Read the books listed to begin opening your awareness ofÂ <em>where</em><span>Â </span>andÂ <em>how</em><span>Â </span>your spiritual nature resides. Once you become aware of these and the understandingsÂ that lead to it, you willÂ <em>realize</em><span>Â </span>when a miracle occurs. That small conviction will be a good boost into the workbook.</p>
<h4>Will I turn water into wine?</h4>
<p>You can do whatever you wantÂ <span>ðŸ˜Ž</span></p>
<h4><span>Do I have to read all of the recommended books?</span></h4>
<p><span>No. One counter culture piece and two spiritual books are all that is considered "mandatory" reading for before A Course in Miracles. As stated before, only ACIM is truly mandatory.</span></p>
<h4><span>How long will this take?</span></h4>
<p><span>If you begin ACIM's workbook with strong conviction and engage fully, you will reach "enlightenment" by lesson 101.</span></p>
<p><span>So, the time until your first miracle + 101 days. The rest of the steps continue indefinitely.</span></p>
<h4><span>What if that doesn't work?</span></h4>
<p><span>It does. <span style="color: white; background-color: white;">If it doesn't work, consider the words "engage fully". If that doesn't reveal the problem, email me.</span></span></p>
<h4><span>Are there more steps?</span></h4>
<p><span>Yes, of course.</span></p>
