        <i>Your past learning must have taught you wrong things simply on the basis that it has not made you happy. Dissatisfaction with learning outcomes myst be a sign of learning failure, since it means that you did not get what you want. If the outcome of yours has made you unhappy and you want a different one, a change in curriculum is obviously necessary.</i>

        <h2>Continued Learning</h2>
        <p>After the book material is completed, the learner should continue the practice of maintaining "miracle readiness" -- that is, continue encouraging miraculous forgiveness.</p>
        <p>Continued learning is actually a process of encouraging <i>unlearning</i> of long-held limiting beliefs.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Is there a club I can join?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://reddit.com/r/iamalexbrady">Yes.</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Do I have to read A Course in Miracles?</h3>
        <p>Yes, read ACIM.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>What is the time requirement?</h3>
        <p><b>Text:</b> Go through the text at your own pace. If you follow alex brady's <a href="/acim/reading-schedule/">reading schedule</a>, expect to spend 20-30 minutes a day reading.</p>
        <p><b>Workbook:</b> Workbook exercises ask for minimal meditation time and momentary rememberances. Part of the practice of the workbook is to not fret about "time requirements." What happens happens; take note.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Are the workbook exercises hard?</h3>
        <p>The workbook is very simple. It provides mental training exercises in Focus, Memory, Attention, Gratitude, etc. At the same time, it imparts the core understandings of a new belief system contrary to the ego's.</p>
        <p>Part of the mind training process is to learn to train your mental faculties in aptitude (e.g. focus/attention) and core beliefs (i.e. identity).</p>
        <p>If you begin to feel behind in mental strength or understanding, be patient with yourself. That is exactly what is being trained. When you begin to experience the benefits of consistent practice, you will be motivated to engage more.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>How can this course guarantee a miracle?</h3>
        <p>We are doing miracles all the time, we just aren't realizing it. Becoming aware of the framework of the psyche presented by ACIM teaches us "where" miracles occur. The mind training practice of the ACIM Workbook teaches us how to encourage "miraculous forgiveness".</p>
        <p>You willÂ <em>realize</em> when a miracle occurs. You'll just know.</p>

        <p><span>(Un)learning continues indefinitely.</span></p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3><span>What if that doesn't work?</span></h3>
