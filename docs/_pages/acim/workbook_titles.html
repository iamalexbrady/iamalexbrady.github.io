<h1>ACIM Workbook Lessons</h1>
<p>
    <b>ACIM's Workbook for Students</b> presents 365 lessons, one for each day of the year, which aim to recondition the student's mind from "condemnation-out-of-fear" to "forgiveness-out-of-love". The workbook lessons train the reader to see oneness in all living things and situations. A Course in Miracles defines "miracle" as the conscious choice to make that mind shift, including its non-observable effects on the minds of others, and observable effects within perception.
</p>
<p>
    The lessons provide personal mental exercises in which the student encourages <u>experiencing</u> the new thought system presented throughout the Couse. In its concluding pages, the Workbook states "this course beginning, not an end" and strengthens the reader to continue onward with faith in their newfound inner guidance.
