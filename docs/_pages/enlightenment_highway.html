        <p>The Enlighenment Highway is the fastest track to personal enlightenment and salvation. Our definition of personal salvation is the realization of your own power to create beyond the world of time and form.</p>

        <p>The exercises to practice are found in <i>A Course in Miracles.</i></p>

    <h2>What to Expect</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Starting point</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Disatisfaction with life situations and the previously traveled roadmaps.</b>
                <p>The previous roadmaps are societal, family, or personal behaviors and routines. Finding these situations and systems to be unable to satisfy an inner quest for truth is a first step.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>The desire to <span style="font-style:oblique;">go fast</span> in a whole new direction.</b></li>
        </ol>

        <i>Your past learning must have taught you wrong things simply on the basis that it has not made you happy. Dissatisfaction with learning outcomes myst be a sign of learning failure, since it means that you did not get what you want. If the outcome of yours has made you unhappy and you want a different one, a change in curriculum is obviously necessary.</i>

        <h3>On the Highway</h3>
        <h4>Velocity</h4>
        <p>This track takes a fairly quick pacing through the text of A Course in Miracles. The ACIM Workbook is introduced after Ch. 8 of the text, and both are studied consecutively. The core volumes of ACIM will be completed within a year.</p>

        <h4>Reflections</h4>
        <p>The primary objective of any learning plan is the acquistion of understanding. Going fast is an insufficient reason for not coming to an understanding of the presented concepts. For that reason, a routine journaling habit is required for the duration of this track.</p>
        <p>Recording thoughts catalyzes the process of solidifying understandings and exposing misunderstandings.</p>

        <h4>Repetition</h4>
        <p>Also known as practice. There are key mental exercises and meditation practices that once remembered innately comprise the active state of enlightenment. This track introduces these skills and mets out time for their practice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>After the Trip</h3>
        <h4>Improved state of mind</h4>
        <p>This Highway leads to divine peace. This peace is reflected in as an overall improvement in moment-to-moment state of mind. Expect increased occurance of security, joy, and appreciate for the present moment.</p>

        <h4>Spiritual enlightenment</h4>
        <p>You have finished this track when you are enlightened. That is the goal and the result. Not being in an enlightened state is a sign of incompletion.</p>
        <p>The state of "enlightenment" can be conceptualized as the following states:

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Is there a club I can join?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://reddit.com/r/iamalexbrady">Yes.</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Do I have to read A Course in Miracles?</h3>
        <p>Yes, read ACIM.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>What is the time requirement?</h3>
        <p><b>Text:</b> Go through the text at your own pace. If you follow alex brady's reading schedule, expect to spend 20-30 minutes a day reading.</p>
        <p><b>Workbook:</b> Workbook exercises ask for minimal meditation time and momentary rememberances. Part of the practice of the workbook is to not fret about "time requirements." What happens happens; take note.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Are the workbook exercises hard?</h3>
        <p>The workbook is very simple. It provides mental training exercises in Focus, Memory, Attention, Gratitude, etc. At the same time, it imparts the core understandings of a new belief system contrary to the ego's.</p>
        <p>Part of the mind training process is to learn to train your mental faculties in aptitude (e.g. focus/attention) and core beliefs (i.e. identity).</p>
        <p>If you begin to feel behind in mental strength or understanding, be patient with yourself. That is exactly what is being trained. When you begin to experience the benefits of consistent practice, you will be motivated to engage more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>How can this course guarantee a miracle?</h3>
        <p>We are doing miracles all the time, we just aren't realizing it. Becoming aware of the framework of the psyche presented by ACIM teaches us "where" miracles occur. The mind training practice of the ACIM Workbook teaches us how to encourage "miraculous forgiveness".</p>
        <p>You will <em>realize</em> when a miracle occurs. You'll just know.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Will I turn water into wine?</h3>

    <div class="section">
        <h3><span>How long will this take?</span></h3>

        <p><span>(Un)learning continues indefinitely.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3><span>What if that doesn't work?</span></h3>
        <p><span>It does. If it doesn't work, consider the words "engage fully". If that doesn't reveal the problem, email me.</span></p>
