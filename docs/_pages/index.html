    <h2>about abcim</h2>
    <p><a href="/abcim/" target="_blank" title="abcim the post iamalexbrady">alex brady's Course in Miracles</a> is a set of steps with the purpose of taking the learner from wherever they are in life to personal spiritual enlightenment. These steps are heavily based on the teaching found within the book <i>A Course in Miracles.</i></p>
    
    <p>Spiritual growth is a personal process. abcim is undertaken as a self-guided journey. Intrapersonal (within-yourself) contemplation and examination of the teachings is encouraged and fundamentally a required aspect of this course. We aim to give you the tools you need to learn from the comfort of your own home. The goal of Higher-Self realization is flexible to any lifestyle.</p>
    
    <p>We provide both ACIM and non-ACIM resources. We also provide an <a href="https://reddit.com/r/iamalexbrady" target="_blank" title="iamalexbrady subreddit">online community</a> for Self-seekers to share and socialize.</p>
