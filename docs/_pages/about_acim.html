<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p><i>A Course in Miracles</i> is a self-study spiritual teaching and program with the aim of bringing the learner to Self-realization as eternal spirit â€“ the fundamental goal of all spiritual paths. This teaching is a proven method of restoring personal communication directly with the One Source of all that ever is, was, and will be. It provides a theoretical framework as well as a 365-day mind training program to guide learners in attaining this goal.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-says">What It Says</h2>
<p>The content of A Course in Miracles is presented in the three sections: "Textbook", "Workbook", and "Manual for Teachers":</p>

<p>The "Textbook" presents a thought system and framework defining new approaches to the concepts of <i>truth</i> and <i>illusion</i>. ACIM teacher, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Wapnick">Dr. Kenneth Wapnick</a>, illustrates the teachings in the Course as a two-level system. About ACIM, he says:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        It states that everything involving time, space, and perception is illusory. It presents a monism which states that God is the only truth and reality: perfect, unchanging, unchangeable, extending only love, though not in time and space, which cannot really be comprehended from a dualistic perspective. The theory further states that all life as we perceive it is actually one life (because God has only one son, sometimes called the collective sonship), dreaming of separation and fragmentation. It claims that eternity is outside time and space and that this dream never occurred in reality and is "already over", though not the (illusory) perception. When addressing the question of how such an illusory dream could arise from a perfect and unchanging God, the Course states that to ask that question is to presume that the time-space dream is real, which it states is not. A Course in Miracles states that to think we exist as individuals is the fundamental error. However, since we experience ourselves in time and space, reading these pages, the Course presents its thought system on a second level:
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The time-space level, or "perceptory" level, which is referred to as "the dream". A Course in Miracles states that this level was "made" by the "sleeping Son" as an attack on God. Furthermore, the "Son" is regarded as not just Jesus, but as all collective life. In this time-space dream, perception is continuously fueled by what it originated from: separation, judgment, and attack. This results in what the Course calls the "sin-guilt-fear" cycle.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We "sinned", or separated, from God by rejecting our Oneness and making a universe of time-space (the Big Bang).</li>
            <li>This results in guilt over our rejection of our Creator and our seeming culpability for the destruction of oneness.</li>
            <li>Due to the guilt, we are fearful of God's wrath.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The "sin-guilt-fear" is described as too horrendous to face, and therefore subsequently projected out, so that to Homo sapiens it seems that evil is everywhere except in himself. The world becomes a threatening place, in which we are born only to fear, fight, and die. The thought that keeps this process going is referred to as "ego", "the wrong mind", or "sense of separation".
        </p>
        <p>
            A Course in Miracles concludes that happiness cannot be found in earthly time-space life, and urges the reader not to commit suicide but rather to make a fundamental mind shift from "condemnation-out-of-fear" (mindlessness) to "forgiveness-out-of-love" (mindfulness), since our "right mind" is outside time-space and cannot be harmed by worldly attacks. According to the Course, we should aim to see "the Face of Christ" in all living things and "accept the Atonement" and ultimately awaken from the dream and return to the eternity of God.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The "Workbook" presents 365 lessons, one for each day of the year, which claim to recondition the student's mind from "condemnation-out-of-fear" to "forgiveness-out-of-love". A Course in Miracles defines "miracle" as the conscious choice to make that mind shift, including its non-observable effects on the minds of others. The workbook lessons attempt to train the reader to see oneness in all living things. The lessons aim at convincing by experience. The core message of the workbook is that, to forgive oneself completely, a person must a) forgive all living things, and b) do this by instruction of the Holy Spirit (i.e. "right mind," "Voice for God" "Inner Teacher," or "intuition"). At the end, after one year, the workbook states "this course beginning, not an end" and strengthens the reader to continue onward with faith in their newfound inner guidance.
</p>

<p>
    The "Manual for Teachers" is a collection of questions and answers. It aims at motivating the reader to become a "teacher of God": a human being living in time and space, but at the same time seeing oneness in everything, having let go of all individual and separate interests, and being fully guided by the "voice" of the Internal Guidance.

<h2 id="early-history">Early History</h2>
<p>
    A Course in Miracles began with the sudden decision of two people to join in a common goal. Their names were Helen Schucman and William Thetford, Professors of Medical Psychology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. They were anything but spiritual. Their relationship with each other was difficult and often strained, and they were concerned with personal and professional acceptance and status. In general, they had considerable investment in the values of the world. Their lives were hardly in accord with anything that the Course advocates. Helen, the one who received the material, describes herself:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Psychologist, educator, conservative in theory and atheistic in belief, I was working in a prestigious and highly academic setting. And then something happened that triggered a chain of events I could never have predicted. The head of my department unexpectedly announced that he was tired of the angry and aggressive feelings our attitudes reflected, and concluded that, "there must be another way." As if on cue I agreed to help him find it. Apparently this Course is the other way.</p>

    <p>
        Three startling months preceded the actual writing, during which time Bill suggested that I write down the highly symbolic dreams and descriptions of the strange images that were coming to me. Although I had grown more accustomed to the unexpected by that time, I was still very surprised when I wrote, "This is a course in miracles." That was my introduction to the Voice. It made no sound, but seemed to be giving me a kind of rapid, inner dictation which I took down in a shorthand notebook. The writing was never automatic. It could be interrupted at any time and later picked up again. It made me very uncomfortable, but it never seriously occurred to me to stop. It seemed to be a special assignment I had somehow, somewhere agreed to complete. It represented a truly collaborative venture between Bill and myself, and much of its significance, I am sure, lies in that. I would take down what the Voice "said" and read it to him the next day, and he typed it from my dictation. I expect he had his special assignment, too. Without his encouragement and support I would never have been able to fulfill mine. The whole process took about seven years. The Text came first, then the Workbook for Students, and finally the Manual for Teachers.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    The names of the collaborators in the recording of the Course do not appear on the cover because the Course can and should stand on its own. It is not intended to become the basis for another cult. Its only purpose is to provide a way in which some people will be able to find their own Internal Teacher.
