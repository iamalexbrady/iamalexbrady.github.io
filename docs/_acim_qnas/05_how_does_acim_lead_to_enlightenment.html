            <i>ACIM</i> goes further in describing why this works: our identity does not lie in the bodies we see. We are mind and spirit beings. The world we exist within is a world of dream or illusion. This is <b><u>not</u></b> a call for reckless behavior. This <b><u>is</u></b> a call for internal examination of what we consider to be reality. This teaching, properly understood, will lead the student to being more present, caring, and loving in their daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The faculty of reason we are appealing to <i>is</i> our higher Self. The peace and security we learn to decide for moment to moment <i>is</i> our true nature – both the ability to decide our mental state intentionally and the live experience of such a state.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have these abilities because of our heredity as God’s children. We are the essence of reason and love, the essence of creation; it is our birthright. We have simply forgotten. <i>ACIM's</i> mind training is a path of remembering that true nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            A model that works is to think of the mind training period as a spiritual growth phase in which we mature into a Creator.

        <p>Your learning potential, properly understood, is limitless because it will lead you to God. You can teach the way to Him and learn it if you follow the Teacher Who knows it and His curriculum for learning it. The curriculum is totally unambiguous because the goal is not divided, and the means and the end are in complete accord. You need offer only undivided attention. Everything else will be given you. For it is your will to learn aright, and nothing can oppose the will of God’s Son. His learning is as unlimited as he is.</p>
