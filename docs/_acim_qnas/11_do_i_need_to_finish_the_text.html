            The theoretical foundation provided by the Text <i>is</i> recommended before beginning the Workbook for Students. The first eight chapters of the Text provides the most general framework for the teaching and is a fine foundation. I recommend reading the first eight chapters before beginning the Workbook. Continue to read the Text if you begin the Workbook before finishing it.

            If at anytime you experience a miracle by your own definition, begin the Workbook while the memory of that event is in your mind. The conviction that arises from witnessing a miraculous event will carry over to the Workbook exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
            The point of the Workbook is to teach you how to do miracles, so do not worry if you have not realized one yet. It would be inappropriate to not begin the Workbook for fear of “not being ready.” This would be akin to not starting a diet <i>because</i> you are overweight. Your willingness is readiness.

        <p>A theoretical foundation such as the text is necessary as a background to make these exercises meaningful. Yet it is the exercises which will make the goal possible. An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. It is the purpose of these exercises to train the mind to think along the lines which the course sets forth.</p>
