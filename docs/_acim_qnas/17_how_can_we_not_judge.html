            17. How can we not judge a terrible event?

            If you see an event as terrible, you have already judged it. This seeing and reacting is how we have all behaved at one point in, if not for all of, our human lives. This habit will live in our behavior for as long as it must. The mental training exercises of forgiveness are meant to help us learn to not allow ourselves be brought to grief and lack of peace due to external events.
        </p>
        <p>
            How to not judge the event remains the same regardless of severity – forgiveness: Be still and watch without allowing the happenings to overwhelm our faculty of reason. A developed sense of trust and reliability in our individual skill in this area is paramount.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ego – our identity and drives as separate individuals – has a way of creating and engaging in situations that have <u>no</u> healthy outcome. If someone commits an event that is meant to cause lack of peace, succumbing to lack of peace (<i>or not</i>) is still each other individual’s decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Who is teaching that punishment is just? Ego. This is the faculty in ourselves that we are learning to unlearn. Every step in this direction is helpful. Diligence and importantly patience is required.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every person, every situation, and every moment is where forgiveness would happen if we were all living from a place of peace. Obviously, there would be no victimizing if we were all consciously seeking to project peace at all times. As it stands, we as a collective humanity, are still learning our forgiveness lessons.

            Be not deceived by the illusions of size and thickness, weight, solidity, and firmness of foundation. Yes, to the body’s eyes it looks like an enormous solid body, immovable as is a mountain. Yet within you there is a Force which no illusions can resist. This body only seems to be immovable; this Force is irresistible in truth. What, then, must happen when they come together? Can the illusion of immovability be long defended from what is quietly passed through and gone beyond?
