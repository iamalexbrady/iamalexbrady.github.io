            <i>A Course in Miracles</i> teaches the “universal curriculum” using traditional Christian terminology. This may be conspicuous to some with a predisposition to be wary of of such terminology, but the terms <u>as given</u> are utmost useful for conveying certain aspects of the teaching.

            You as God created you – not your ego identity, but your spirit or soul – are an aspect of the Son of God. You are a Child of God. This is important because you must conceive of gaining control of your mental space as a hereditary <u>inevitability</u>. It is your birthright, and the final stage of evolution of your time on Earth.

            <b>The parent-child relationship is indispensable to this teaching.</b>

            God the Father is calling and guiding His Son to mature to His power of Creation. This is a power beyond space-time. This is the power by which the belief in space-time made such universe and all we see in it. It is up to each of us to rediscover and grow this capacity within ourself.

            You are entitled to miracles because of what you are. You will receive miracles because of what God is. And you will offer miracles because you are one with God. Again, how simple is salvation! It is merely a statement of your true Identity. It is this that we will celebrate today. Your claim to miracles does not lie in your illusions about yourself. It does not depend on any magical powers you have ascribed to yourself, nor on any of the rituals you have devised. It is inherent in the truth of what you are. It is implicit in what God your Father is. It was ensured in your creation, and guaranteed by the laws of God.
