            16. How should we behave? What about morality?

            What we have historically called “morality” and ethics has been based on judgements of what is right and wrong. From the definition of forgiveness provided along with the goal of its true attainment, it should be obvious that the judgement required for what the world deems morality is not an appropriate lens with which to view the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a code of behavior which dictates that in every moment we be willing to appeal to our faculty of reason, as the Course calls Holy Spirit, for guidance with our behavior. To word a different way, the new behavior code proposed is a constant state of forgiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Does this mean all behavior is acceptable and local laws and codes should not be followed?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>No.</b> This does not mean all behavior is acceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
            By following the loving and benign guidance of inner intuition, a reasonable act will maintain the physical, mental, and emotional well-being for <b>all</b> persons involved. In fact, it can be seen <i>from</i> the effects of the action taken whether the action was produced by reason (holy guidance) or chaotic thinking (egoic guidance).
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>How do I feel?</li>
            <li>Is there peace in my awareness?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            A Course in Miracles does not dictate behavior <u>other than</u> an individual being willing to ask for God's guidance in any and every moment, willingly and pre-emptively. This is not expected of a new student; being willing to be guided by inner reason is close enough. As trust grows, behavior will follow.

            Does what God created need defense? No one can become an advanced teacher of God until he fully understands that defenses are but foolish guardians of mad illusions. The more grotesque the dream, the fiercer and more powerful its defenses seem to be. Yet when the teacher of God finally agrees to look past them, he finds that nothing was there. Slowly at first he lets himself be undeceived. But he learns faster as his trust increases. It is not danger that comes when defenses are laid down. It is safety. It is peace. It is joy. And it is God.
