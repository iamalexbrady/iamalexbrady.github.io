            A miracle is a change of mind &ndash; a correction of a misunderstanding &ndash; that is reflected within the perception of yourself and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given that a core principle of truth taught by <i>A Course in Miracles</i> is that our <b>beliefs</b> cause <b>perception</b>, a miracle is the perceptual manifestation of a change of belief. The forgiveness principles in application cause this change. Forgiveness removes our belief that a person, event, or thing is a cause of disturbance. What we once believed the cause for disturbance, we are then guided to see as an opportunity to correct our state of mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, our perception is a projection of our beliefs. Our beliefs are the <b><u>cause</u></b> of the world we see. Mind is the <b><u>cause</u></b> of material perception. A change of mind <b><u>causes</u></b> a change in perceptual awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are the cause of the world we see. This teaching may hurt to accept at first, but two conclusions should be clear:
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha-paren-list">
            <li>Accepting this as true puts us in the powerful position of being able to correct these undesirable beliefs.</li>
            <li>The “hurt” of accepting this truth is just another type of pain that can be forgiven away.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A mind that has reached a state of perfect peace can only project peace. This is the example Jesus of Nazareth provided.</p>
        <p>When Jesus turned water into wine, he was soothing his mother's anxiety.<br/>When he healed the sick, he was correcting misunderstandings that sickness was possible.<br/> When he replaced the Roman soldier’s ear, he was reminding the man that there is no cause for suffering or loss. The illusion of pain cannot stand before the Reality of truth.
            </p>
        <p>When our minds truly understand that there is no cause for disturbance in any specific situation, the perception of the situation alters up to and including changed physicality. You can search the web for examples of what miracles students of ACIM have experienced, but remember: All things are possible. There is no order of difficulty in miracles; a “bigger” illusion is as easily dispelled as a “small” one.</p>
        <p>
            Miracles are easily realized via the forgiveness practice <i>A Course in Miracles</i> guides. Because a miracle is a correction of a misunderstanding to an understanding that the learner was previously unaware of, it should be clear that a teacher with a different set of understandings is required to convey the new interpretations. This is why the learning from Inner Teacher ACIM points us to is of utmost importance.

    <div class="reference">
        <p>The miracle is taken first on faith, because to ask for it implies the mind has been made ready to conceive of what it cannot see and does not understand. Yet faith will bring its witnesses to show that what it rested on is really there. And thus the miracle will justify your faith in it, and show it rested on.</p>
