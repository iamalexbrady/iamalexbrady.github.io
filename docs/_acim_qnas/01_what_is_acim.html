            <i>A Course in Miracles</i> is a self-study spiritual teaching and program with the aim of bringing the learner to Self-realization as eternal spirit – the goal of all spiritual paths. This teaching is a proven direct method of restoring personal communication with the One Source of all that ever is, was, and will be. It provides a theoretical framework as well as a 365-day mind training program to guide learners in attaining this goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the work of Jesus Christ through scribe Helen Shucman and editor Bill Thetford. It was popularized by the teaching of Kenneth Wapnick. Read more of its history at <a href="{{ about_acim_url }}">{{site.url}}{{about_acim_url}}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is composed of three parts: A Text, a Workbook, and a Teacher’s Manual.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Text:</b> Foundational theory and framework of ideology</li>
                <li><b>The Workbook:</b> A 365-day program in mind training that guides students through the steps of Self-realization.</li>
                <li><b>The Manual for Teachers:</b> a collection of questions and answers regarding the practical day-to-day living of the teaching within <i>A Course in Miracles</i> as well as spiritual concerns not covered in the Text.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The Course itself says it is only one of many spiritual paths that lead to God or Self-realization. In modern times, it is the most easily accessible and straightforward approach at what is undoubtedly the highest goal attainable by humanity – personal salvation and salvation of the world.</p>
        <p>Attain your Higher Self from the comfort of your own seat. No dogma. No rituals. No sin. No punishment. Simply a teaching of the infinite and eternal nature of Love.</p>

            This is a course in miracles. It is a required course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you may elect what you want to take at a given time.
        </p>
        <p>The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyondwhat can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awarenessof love’s presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.</p>
        <p>This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:</p>
        <div class="inner-quote">
            <p>Nothing real can be threatened.</p>
            <p>Nothing unreal exists.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Herein lies the peace of God.</p>
