            Every person’s Course in Miracles experience is and will be necessarily individualized. That’s part of the beauty of the Course; as you go through it, it is personalized to <u>you.</u> The "right way" is the way you do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            That being the case, the foremost guidance I can give as a 3<sup>rd</sup> party is that you intentionally and consciously go through <i>A Course in Miracles</i> at your own pace and in whatever manner makes sense to you. Reasonably speaking, that’s the only way it can be done – by your own decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is general guidance for those seeking a starting point:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Step 0:</b> It will be helpful if you have some concept of the spiritual dimension within yourself. This is satisfied by exposure to spiritual ideas as taught by/within the provided recommendation list.</li>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b> Read the first 8 chapters of the ACIM Text. This satisfies the “theoretical foundation” recommended for the workbook. Continue reading the Text as you go through the Workbook.</li>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b> Begin the ACIM Workbook and go through it at the recommended pace. There are 365 lessons and the training period is one year. Do not approach the Workbook haphazardly or carelessly; the exercises are intentionally simple enough to fit into any reasonable lifestyle. Your growth will be directly proportional to the willingness you put into the Workbook exercises.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            That's it.
        </p>
        <p>
            What about the Teacher’s Manual? Read it whenever you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day ACIM will <i>click</i>; you will understand the <b>reality</b> behind the teaching that “as you believe, so you will perceive.” Chances are this will come sometime after you realize your first miracle. That day you will want to scour every inch of ACIM for better understanding. Perfect time for the Manual if you haven’t already read it.
