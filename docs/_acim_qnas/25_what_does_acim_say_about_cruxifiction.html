            Assault can ultimately be made <i>only</i> on the body. There is little doubt that one <i>body</i> can assault another, and can even destroy it. But if destruction <i>itself</i> is impossible, then <i>anything</i> that is destructible cannot be real. Therefore, its destruction does <u>not</u> justify anger. To the extent to which you believe that it does, you must be accepting false premises and <i>teaching them to others.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The message which the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not necessary to perceive <i>any</i> form of assault in persecution because you cannot <i>be</i> persecuted. If you respond with anger, you <i>must</i> be equating yourself with the destructible, and are therefore regarding yourself insanely.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are free to perceive yourselves as persecuted if you choose. But you might remember when you <i>do</i> choose to react that way that I was persecuted as the world judges, and did <u>not</u> share this evaluation for myself. And because I did <u>not</u> share it, I did not strengthen it. I therefore offered a <i>different</i> interpretation of attack, and one which I <i>do</i> want to share with you. If you will <i>believe</i> it, you will help me <i>teach</i> it.

        <p>The message of the crucifixion is perfectly clear:</p>
        <p class="inner-quote">Teach only love, for that is what you are.</p>
        <p>If you interpret the crucifixion in any other way, you are using it as a weapon for assault rather than as the call for peace for which it was intended.</p>
        <p>The Apostles often misunderstood it, and for the same reason that anyone misunderstands it. Their own imperfect love made them vulnerable to projection, and out of their own fear they spoke of the "wrath of God" as His retaliatory weapon. Nor could they speak of the crucifixion entirely without anger, because their sense of guilt had <i>made</i> them angry.</p>
