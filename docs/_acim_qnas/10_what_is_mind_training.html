            <i>A Course in Miracles</i> is a special curriculum in mental/spiritual training in the principles of forgiveness. This includes meditative exercises on peaceful and encouraging ideas and daily remembrance activities that mimic the goal of consulting with our faculty of reason whenever possible throughout a day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The training provided by the Course is the mental equivalent of diet and exercise for the body. Diet and exercise lead to weight loss; the Courseâ€™s training leads to peace and enlightenment. It works <b><u>definitively</u></b> but if you actually do it. A little helps a little, a lot helps a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Course provides a Workbook for Students which is a 365-day training program. The workbook is meant to take you from <i>where you are</i> to a state of understanding and <u>realizing</u> the benefits of forgiveness.

        <p>The exercises are very simple. They do not require more than a few minutes, and it does not matter where or when you do them. They need no preparation. They are numbered, running from 1 to 365.</p>
        <p>It is recommended that each exercise be repeated several times a day, preferably in a different place each time, and if possible in every situation in which you spend any long period of time. The purpose is to train the mind to generalize the lessons, so that you will understand that each of them is as applicable to one situation as it is to another.</p>
        <p>The purpose of these exercises is to train the mind to a different perception of everything in the world.</p>
