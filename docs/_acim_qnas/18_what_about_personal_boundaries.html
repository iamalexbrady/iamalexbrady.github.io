            Hypotheticals are dangerous concepts on which to build behavior codes. If it is not presently occurring, it is <b><u>not</u></b>. Casual consideration is an act that will be taken absent-mindedly, undoubtedly, but to allow anxiety or lack of peace to arise from an event that is not presently occurring is self-defeating.
        </p>
        <p>
            We know <u>in the moment</u> the correct action to take. If it is proper to disengage for whatever reason, the response will be apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, consult inner reason. This need not take long. If a quick reaction is necessary, act quickly! There is no need to over-think. If the action that is taken is protecting ourself, our property, our family, physically or otherwise, the response will be called for and apparent.

            Our higher faculty of reason knows the correct action to take that will be beneficial to <b>all</b> parties involved and not cause more egoic chaos. He will not put us in any situation that is harmful physically, mentally, or emotionally as that is the <i>complete opposite</i> of Godâ€™s will. That is the level of trust we are seeking to develop.
        </p>
        <p>The guidance of the higher Self is <b>reasonable.</b> Your behavior should reflect that. Trust your intuition.</p>

            Forget not, when you feel the need arise to be defensive about <i>anything</i>, you have identified <i>your self</i> with an illusion. And therefore feel that you are weak <i>because</i> you are alone. This is the cost of all illusions. [All] rest on the belief that you are separate. [All] seem to stand, heavy and solid and immovable, between you and your brother. And [there is] not one that truth cannot pass over lightly and so easily that you <i>must</i> be convinced, in spite of what you <i>thought</i> it was, that it is nothing. If you forgive each other, this <i>must</i> happen. For it <i>is</i> your unwillingness to overlook what seems to stand between you that makes it look impenetrable and <i>defends</i> the illusion of its immovability.
