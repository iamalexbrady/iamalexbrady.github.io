            The true, living God spoken of in A Course in Miracles is a non-dualistic Being, in Whom absolutely no opposites reside. It is the Creator of all life, a Being of pure Love, the Source and Cause of non-physical reality. This God is all-encompassing, outside of Whom is literally nothing. He is Everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            This God did not create the world we see, but only resides and creates within the spiritual realm. The world of perception, guilt, and separate bodies is a world of illusion â€“ a dream where the impossible seems to have occurred. God is the state within our Self wherein we remember this is true.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Course states that the nature of God and Oneness cannot be written about because it is a pure non-dualistic reality. Spoken and written word is necessarily dualistic in nature and cannot convey the truth. Words fall short. God must be <b><u>experienced.</u></b>

        <p>
            Oneness is simply the idea God is. And in His Being, He encompasses all things. No mind holds anything but Him. We say "God is," and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless. There are no lips to speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel that it is now aware of something not itself. It has united with its Source. And like its Source Itself, it merely is.
