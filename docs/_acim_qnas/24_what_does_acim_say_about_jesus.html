            The Name of Jesus is the Name of one who was a man but saw the face of Christ in all his brothers and remembered God. So he became identified with Christ, a man no longer, but at one with God. The man was an illusion, for he seemed to be a separate being, walking by himself, within a body that appeared to hold his self from Self, as all illusions do. Yet who can save unless he sees illusions and then identifies them as what they are? Jesus remains a Savior because he saw the false without accepting it as true. And Christ needed his form that He might appear to men and save them from their own illusions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In his complete identification with the Christ &ndash; the perfect Son of God, His one creation and His happiness, forever like Himself and One with Him – Jesus became what all of us must be. He led the way for us to follow him. He leads us back to God because he saw the road before him, and he followed it. He made a clean distinction, still obscure to us, between the false and true. He offered us all a final demonstration that it is impossible to kill Godʹs Son; nor can his life in any way be changed by sin and evil, malice, fear or death.
        </p>
        <p>
            And therefore all your sins have been forgiven because they carried no effects at all. And so they were but dreams. Arise with him who showed you this because you owe him this who shared your dreams that they might be dispelled. And shares them still, to be at one with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is he the Christ? Oh yes, along with you. His little life on earth was not enough to teach the mighty lesson that he learned for all of us. He will remain with you to lead you from the hell you made to God. And when you join your will with his, your sight will be his vision, for the eyes of Christ are shared. Walking with him is just as natural as walking with a brother whom you knew since you were born, for such indeed he is. Some bitter idols have been made of him who would be only brother to the world. Forgive him your illusions, and behold how dear a brother he would be to you. For he will set your mind at rest at last and carry it with you unto your God.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is he Godʹs only Helper? No, indeed. For Christ takes many forms with different names until their oneness can be recognized. But Jesus is for you the bearer of Christʹs single message of the Love of God. You need no other. It is possible to read his words and benefit from them without accepting him into your life. Yet he would help you yet a little more if you will share your pains and joys with him, and leave them both to find the peace of God. Yet still it is his lesson most of all that he would have you learn, and it is this:
        </p>
        <p class="inner-quote">
            “There is no death because the Son of God is like his Father. Nothing you can do can change Eternal Love. Forget your dreams of sin and guilt, and come with me instead to share the resurrection of Godʹs Son. And bring with you all those whom He has sent to you to care for as I care for you.”

            I am come as a light into a world that denies itself everything. It does this simply by dissociating itself <i>from</i> everything. It is therefore an illusion of isolation, maintained by fear of the same loneliness which is its illusion. I have told you that I am with you always, even to the end of the world. That is <i>why</i> I am the light of the world. If I am with you in the loneliness of the world, <i>the loneliness is gone</i>. You <i>cannot</i> maintain the illusion of loneliness if you are <i>not</i> alone. My purpose, then, <i>is</i> to overcome the world. I do not attack it, but my light must dispel it because of what it <i>is</i>.
