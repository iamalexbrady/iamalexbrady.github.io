            The consultation with inner guidance starts like this:
        </p>
        <p class="inner-quote">
            "What do I want to achieve in this situation? What is my purpose?"
        </p>
        <p>
            If we have taken a purpose of a) self-love, peace, and happiness or b) forgiveness, the action that arises will satisfy that purpose. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Actions that arise <i>always</i> satisfy our purpose regardless of intent. Problematic situations come up when our purpose is to satisfy egoic drives – historically the case for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a quick reason consultation, the action to be taken is the apparently obvious decision – it's the thing we want to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            A reasonable question: Isn’t this what we’ve been doing our whole life?
        </p>
        <p>
            Our typical behavior is to not stop to consult inner reason before acting. We consult our previous behaviors and habits, culturally acceptable habits, and lower-level desires like sex and drugs. Our typical desire is to want things that turn out unsatisfactorily, unlasting happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            How can we tell if we are listening to the guidance of reason? After acting, we reflect:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>How do I feel?</li>
            <li>Is there peace in my awareness?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Honest reflection is an important part of the early stages of gaining discernment. It's a learning process. According to <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, learning this is the <u>literal</u> purpose of the creation of time and matter. Eventually you will learn how to want and consistently achieve “the peace of God" – and undeniable sense of security and joy – only.

    <div class="reference">
        <p>
            [Ask yourself:]
        </p>
        <p class="inner-quote">
            Do I desire a world I rule instead of one that rules me?<br/>Do I desire a world where I am powerful instead of helpless?<br/>Do I desire a world in which I have no enemies and cannot sin?<br/>And do I want to see what I denied because it is the truth?
        </p>
        <p>
            [...] And then it will be clear to you that, as you look on the <i>effects</i> of sin in <i>any</i> form, all you need do is simply ask yourself,
        </p>
        <p class="inner-quote">
            Is this what I would see? Do I <b>want</b> this?
        </p>
        <p>
            This is your one decision; this the <i>condition</i> for what occurs. It is irrelevant to how it happens but <u>not</u> to <i>why</i>. You have control of this. And if you <i>choose</i> to see a world <u>without</u> an enemy in which you are <u>not</u> helpless, the <i>means</i> to see it <u>will</u> be given you.
