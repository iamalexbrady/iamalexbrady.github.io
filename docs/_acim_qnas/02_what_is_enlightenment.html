            <b>enlightened (adj.)</b> – freed from ignorance and misunderstanding; based on full comprehension
        </p>
        <p>
            Enlightenment is the state of understanding, the state of comprehension.

            Truly come to an understanding of any of the truths proposed by A Course in Miracles and we can be called enlightened spiritually because that is the subject matter of the book.

            All terms are potentially controversial, and those who seek controversy will find it. Yet those who seek clarification will find it as well. They must, however, be willing to overlook controversy, recognizing that it is a defense against truth in the form of a delaying maneuver. Theological considerations as such are necessarily controversial, since they depend on belief and can therefore be accepted or rejected. A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed. Here alone consistency becomes possible because here alone uncertainty ends.

        <p>
            The ego will demand many answers this course does not give. It does not recognize as questions the mere form of a question to which an answer is impossible. The ego may ask, ʺHow did the impossible occur?ʺ, ʺTo what did the impossible happen?ʺ, and may ask this in many forms. Yet there is no answer; only an experience. Seek only this, and do not let theology delay you.
