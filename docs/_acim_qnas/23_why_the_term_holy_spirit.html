            23. Why use the term Holy Spirit?

            The Holy Spirit is the Guide that is given each of us that will <u>teach</u> us the path back to our true Identity. If we only had ego-identified teachers, this path would be <u>impossible</u> to find on a mass scale because experience is necessarily not able to be shared via body-to-body communication. The Holy Spirit resides within our mental space, intangible, and guides through discernment, intuition, and conveyed understandings 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The concept of having a Guide Who is accessible, loves us dearly, and <u>knows</u> the next step in our individual journey is indispensable to this teaching.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The term “Holy Spirit” can be thought of as the “Spirit of Wholeness”. Within each of us individually, we have the memory of our Oneness with all of creation. The memory of God and our Identity.

            The Holy Spirit is described as the remaining communication link between God and His separated sons.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Holy Spirit abides in the part of your mind that is part of the Christ Mind. He represents your Self and your Creator, Who are One. He speaks for God and also for you, being joined with both. And therefore it is He Who proves them One. He seems to be a Voice, for in that form He speaks Godʹs Word to you. He seems to be a Guide through a far country, for you need that form of help.21 He seems to be whatever meets the needs you think you have. But He is not deceived when you perceive your self entrapped in needs you do not have. It is from these He would deliver you. It is from these that He would make you safe.
