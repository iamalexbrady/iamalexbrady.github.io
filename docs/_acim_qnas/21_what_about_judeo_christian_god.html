            The God of Abraham has been <i>taught</i> as the sovereign entity of our dualistic world. Biblical scripture, read with discernment, also point to the non-dualistic God that Jesus of Nazareth came to know and teach.

            I came to fulfill the law by reinterpreting it. The law itself, if properly understood, offers only protection to man. It is those who have not yet “changed their minds” who entered the “hellfire” concept into it.

            While the fathers and prophets of these religions likely entered into the higher spiritual space with the One Creator of All, it is apparent that the learnings given to them were misunderstood and misapplied almost immediately upon entering and begin taught within the physical realms. Where ideas of an external, punishing God of Fear made their way into Biblical text proper, Christ reveals and corrects these misunderstandings in <i>A Course in Miracles</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Course unequivocally states that God did not create the world we see and does not interact with, respond to, or punish for the goings on in this world of illusion. God resides in Truth – <i>is</i> Truth – and by definition illusion is "not-truth." God is Love. Only.
        </p>
        <p>
            The biblical God carries many qualities of a pseudo-human entity who demands sacrifice of His followers and responds with punishment when those demands are not met. This God perceives wrong-doing, and if a human is perceived as doing wrongly, God will cut this soul off from love <b>forever.</b> He causes mass extinction events, exhibits tribalism, and kills children as they sleep for political goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only salvation provided by this “God” is through the torture, murder, and sacrifice of his faithful servants and only begotten Son.
        </p>
        <p>
            It must be clear that this behavior is <b><u>antithetical</u></b> to a God defined as only consisting of Love. The biblical God is best conceived of as the mistaken projections of the Bible writers' egos. One of the first forgiveness lessons, i.e. correction of understanding, requested of learners of the Course is to see that a God with such qualities – favoritism, punishment, and intolerance – can <b><u>only</u></b> be a mistaken projection of the egoic mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            The understanding of the laws and teachings of a God of Oneness and mentality <i>outside of space and time</i> has been misunderstood by both ancient and modern spiritual leaders who have viewed the concept of God through their own lens of separate, physical identity.

            People can't observe the coming of God's kingdom. They can't say, "Here it is!" or "There it is!" You see, God's kingdom is within you.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Bible and other influential holy books <i>surely</i> spring from the Source of Truth, but all spiritual teachings are necessarily limited by the requirement of teaching <b>spirit</b> in the world of <b>form</b>. Teachings of all types are limited by its teachers' own shortcomings of understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            While using dualistic concepts such as guidance and forgiveness to express non-dual truths, <i>A Course in Miracles</i> is firm in its correction of the misbelief of a God that acknowledges and reacts to a world that, from His perspective, is an impossibility, an illusion, a dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, the stories and allegories told of God are only as useful as they help the learner come to the experiential realization of the One living God within their own frame of reference. It is up to each individual to come to their own understanding of God and cultivate that experience.

            It cannot be the “sinner’s” wish for death is just as strong as is God’s Will for life. Nor can the basis of a world He did not make be firm and sure as Heaven. How could it be that hell and Heaven are the same? And is it possible that what He did not will cannot be changed? What is immutable besides His Will? And what can share Its attributes except Itself? What wish can rise against His Will and be immutable? If you could realize nothing is changeless but the Will of God, this course would not be difficult for you. For it is this that you do not believe. Yet there is nothing else you could believe if you but looked at what it really is.
